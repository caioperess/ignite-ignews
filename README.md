## ðŸ“° About the project

ig.news is a blog where users can access the full content of each post through a subscription.
The blog has a purchase system integrated with STRIPE, where the user can buy his subscription to view the complete content of the entire blog. If the user does not wish to opt for the subscription, he will have limited access to the content of the posts.
